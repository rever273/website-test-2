        <p>The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are
            approximately the same size which is similar to some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading,
            by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an
            overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks
            up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from
            below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Leucism is extremely rare in this species, but has been documented at least three times; in a pup that washed
            ashore in Australia and died, in another pup in South Africa, and a third six-metre adult male in
            Indonesia. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones,
            ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the
            teeth saw off large chunks of flesh. Great white sharks, like other mackerel sharks, have larger eyes
            than other shark species in proportion to their body size. The iris of the eye is a deep blue instead of
            black.
