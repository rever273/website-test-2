        <h1>KORG</h1>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Korg is a Kronan warrior who was imprisoned on Sakaar and was forced to participate in the Grandmaster's
            Contest of Champions alongside his friend Miek. Upon meeting Thor, Korg helped him and Bruce Banner escape
            from Sakaar with help from Valkyrie. Sparking a rebellion, he led the former prisoners of Sakaar, along with
            Loki, on a trip to Asgard, where they provided reinforcements and fought the Berserkers. As Ragnarök was
            unleashed, Korg witnessed the destruction of Asgard and stayed with the surviving Asgardians on their flight
            towards Earth. Months later, their ship was attacked by Thanos, although Korg escaped.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After the Snap, Korg was one of the survivors and relocated in New Asgard on Earth with Miek and the rest of
            the surviving Asgardians. He spent five years keeping Thor company as he descended into a drunken hermit
            over his failure to stop Thanos. In 2023, Korg joined the battle to defeat an alternate Thanos, before
            heading back to New Asgard under Valkyrie's new rule. The following year, he traveled to Indigarr, which he
            helped defend alongside Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Korg and Thor then returned to New Asgard after they learned it was under attack by Gorr the God Butcher.
            When Gorr kidnapped the Asgardian children, Korg traveled with Thor and his allies on their quest to
            Omnipotence City, where they sought the aid of Zeus. Korg was nearly killed when Zeus struck him with his
            Thunderbolt, losing most of his body in the process. After failing to defeat Gorr in the Shadow Realm, Korg
            stayed behind in New Asgard. As his body fully regenerated, he met another Kronan named Dwayne, with whom he
            had a son.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Sometime after he became an adult, Korg was forced to become one of the Grandmaster's champions on the planet
            Sakaar after his rebellion against him failed when he was unable to collect enough support. The only people
            that turned up were his mother and her boyfriend, whom he hated. He reflects on this later in his life,
            joking that he "didn't print enough pamphlets." Korg met and became friends with another gladiator, Miek.
