        <p>Great white sharks were previously thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now
            believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33
            years to reach sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed to be more than 30
            years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years.
            Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of
            40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate, long gestation
            period of 11 months and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental
            change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Little is known about the great white shark's mating habits, and mating behaviour had not been observed in
            this species until 1997 and properly documented in 2020. It was assumed previously to be possible that whale
            carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. According to the
            testimony of fisherman Dick Ledgerwood, who observed two great white sharks mating in the area near Port
            Chalmers and Otago Harbor, in New Zealand, it is theorized that great white sharks mate in shallow water
            away from feeding areas and continually roll belly to belly during copulation. Birth has never been
            observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs
            develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month
            gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks
            participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and
            summer. The largest number of pups recorded for this species is 14 pups from a single mother measuring
            4.5 m (15 ft) that was killed incidentally off Taiwan in 2019</p>
        <br>
        <p>On July 9, 2023, the first footage of what was likely a newborn great white shark was filmed via aerial drone
            off of Southern California, off Carpinteria, after a large adult shark was seen diving to the bottom roughly
            1,000 ft (300 m) from the shoreline, after which the smaller shark rose to the surface. The young shark,
            estimated up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long, was pale in color, possibly due to what may be an embryonic covering,
            possibly intrauterine milk, was seen sloughing off the skin of the young shark. Adult sharks filmed in the
            area days prior suggest the area may be a birthing ground for pregnant females. This footage was published
            in the journal Environmental Biology of Fishes on January 29, 2024.
