        <p>Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between 12 and
            24 °C (54 and 75 °F), with greater concentrations in the United States (Northeast and California), South
            Africa, Japan, Oceania, Chile, and the Mediterranean including the Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus. One of the
            densest-known populations is found around Dyer Island, South Africa. Juvenile great white sharks inhabit a
            more narrow band of temperatures, between 14 and 24 °C (57 and 75 °F), in shallow coastal nurseries.
            Increased observation of young sharks in areas they were not previously common, such as Monterey Bay on the
            Central California coast, suggest climate change may be reducing the range of juvenile great white sharks
            and shifting it toward the poles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The great white is an epipelagic fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game, such as fur seals
            (Arctocephalus ssp.), sea lions, cetaceans, other sharks, and large bony fish species. In the open ocean, it
            has been recorded at depths as great as 1,200 m (3,900 ft). These findings challenge the traditional notion
            that the great white is a coastal species.</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to a recent study, California great whites have migrated to an area between Baja California
            Peninsula and Hawaii known as the White Shark Café to spend at least 100 days before migrating back to Baja.
            On the journey out, they swim slowly and dive down to around 900 m (3,000 ft). After they arrive, they
            change behaviour and do short dives to about 300 m (980 ft) for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that
            was tagged off the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year. A
            similar study tracked a different great white shark from South Africa swimming to Australia's northwestern
            coast and back, a journey of 20,000 km (12,000 mi; 11,000 nmi) in under nine months. These observations
            argue against traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, and open up the
            possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously thought to have been discrete. The
            reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include
            seasonal feeding or mating.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the Northwest Atlantic, the white shark populations off the New England coast were nearly eradicated due
            to over-fishing. In recent years, the populations have grown greatly, largely due to the increase in seal
            populations on Cape Cod, Massachusetts since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972.
            Currently very little is known about the hunting and movement patterns of great whites off Cape Cod, but
            ongoing studies hope to offer insight into this growing shark population. The Massachusetts Division of
            Marine Fisheries (part of the Department of Fish and Game) began a population study in 2014; since 2019,
            this research has focused on how humans can avoid conflict with sharks.</p>
