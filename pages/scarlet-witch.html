        <p>Wanda Maximoff was a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro. Born with the
            latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark and rallied
            anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an effort to help
            purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments with the Scepter
            under the supervision of Baron Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening and amplifying Wanda's powers. While
            her brother developed super-speed, she attained various psionic abilities. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined
            Ultron to get their revenge on Stark, but abandoned him when they discovered his true intentions to
            eradicate humanity. Wanda and Pietro joined the Avengers during the Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro
            was killed during the battle but Wanda survived, and shortly after relocated to the Avengers Compound in the
            United States of America.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 2016, during the Attack on the IFID Headquarters, Maximoff tried to contain an explosion caused by
            Crossbones, who pulled the cord on his own explosive vest, but failed in her mission and inadvertently
            destroyed a nearby building with the blast, killing many of its occupants, much to her horror. Maximoff felt
            responsible for what happened, and since she was unsure of her decision about the Sokovia Accords, she ended
            up under Vision's watch, who made every effort to make her feel better. However, Clint Barton convinced her
            to run away and join Steve Rogers in his fight against Tony Stark's team. As a result of her actions during
            the Clash of the Avengers and her violation of the Sokovia Accords, Maximoff was briefly imprisoned on the
            Raft before Rogers freed her alongside her teammates.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the next two years, Maximoff reunited and reconciled with Vision, and together the two started living
            off the grid in Europe, forming a romantic relationship. In 2018, they were ambushed by the Black Order, who
            sought the Mind Stone, and rejoined the Avengers to seek refuge in Wakanda. Maximoff took part in the city's
            defence when the Black Order invaded the city, where she was forced to kill Vision to prevent Thanos from
            completing the Infinity Gauntlet. However, she witnessed Thanos resurrect and kill Vision before initiating
            the Snap, which claimed Maximoff's life. After the victims of the Snap were resurrected in 2023, Maximoff
            was among the many heroes who fought during the Battle of Earth, defeating Thanos and his armies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Soon after, Maximoff became overwhelmed by immense grief from her recent personal losses, unwittingly
            unleashing her Chaos Magic powers to enthrall the citizens of Westview into creating an alternate idyllic
            paradise of classical sitcom tropes. With a recreated Vision as her husband, Maximoff lived her ideal life,
            even producing twin sons, Tommy and Billy. Further complicating the crisis was Agatha Harkness, a fellow
            witch who sought to understand the nature of Maximoff's new reality, and a S.W.O.R.D. operation led by Tyler
            Hayward who wished to eliminate her. Maximoff, now knowing her own identity as the fabled Scarlet Witch,
            defeated Harkness and the S.W.O.R.D. agents, and dispelled her reality, erasing her family in the process.
            As she was now wanted, Maximoff fled into isolation and began studying the Darkhold.</p>
