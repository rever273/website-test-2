        <p>In great white sharks, sexual dimorphism is present, and females are generally larger than males. Male great
            whites on average measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft) in length, while females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16
            ft). Adults of this species weigh 522–771 kg (1,151–1,700 lb) on average; however, mature females can
            have an average mass of 680–1,110 kg (1,500–2,450 lb). The largest females have been verified up to 6.1 m
            (20 ft) in length and an estimated 1,905 kg (4,200 lb) in weight, perhaps up to 2,268 kg (5,000 lb).
            The maximum size is subject to debate because some reports are rough estimations or speculations performed
            under questionable circumstances. Among living cartilaginous fish, only the whale shark (Rhincodon
            typus), the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) and the giant manta ray (Manta birostris), in that order, are
            on average larger and heavier. These three species are generally quite docile in disposition and given to
            passively filter-feeding on very small organisms. This makes the great white shark the largest extant
            macropredatory fish. Great white sharks measure approximately 1.2 m (3.9 ft) when born, and grow about 25 cm
            (9.8 in) every year.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A complete female great white shark specimen in the Museum of Zoology in Lausanne, and claimed by De
            Maddalena et al. (2003) as the largest preserved specimen, measured 5.83 m (19.1 ft) in total body length
            with the caudal fin in its depressed position, and is estimated to have weighed 2,000 kg (4,410 lb).
            According to J. E. Randall, the largest white shark reliably measured was a 5.94 m (19.5 ft) specimen
            reported from Ledge Point, Western Australia in 1987, but it is unclear whether that length was measured
            with the caudal fin in its depressed or natural position. Another great white specimen of similar size
            was a female caught in August 1988 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, off Prince Edward Island, by David
            McKendrick of Alberton, Prince Edward Island. This female great white was 6.1 m (20 ft) long, as verified by
            the Canadian Shark Research Center.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A report of a specimen reportedly measuring 6.4 m (21 ft) in length and with a body mass estimated at
            3,175–3,324 kg (7,000–7,328 lb) caught in 1945 off the coast of Cuba was at the time considered
            reliable by some experts. However, later studies revealed this particular specimen to be
            around 4.9 m (16 ft) in length, i.e. a specimen within the typical maximum size range.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The largest great white recognized by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) is one caught by Alf
            Dean in southern Australian waters in 1959, weighing 1,208 kg (2,663 lb).</p>
