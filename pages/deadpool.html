        <p>Dead pool is the character that this wiki is based off of. He stars in several comics, first appearing in New
            Mutants #98 back in February 1984 Deadpool, also known as Wade Wilson, was created by artist and writer Rob
            Liefeld, as well as writer Fabian Nicieza. He was originally depicted as a supervillain in both New Mutants
            and X-Force, but has since become an antihero. He is disfigured and mentally unstable with chunks of memory
            missing. Deadpool is known under the editorial names Merc with a Mouth and thanks to his talkative motion
            and constant breaking of the fourth wall for comedic effect. Deadpool's popularity has increased over time
            in 2012 he was first made with the outfit of the currant day.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Deadpool first appeared in The New Mutants #98 in February 1991. Ven Mendez came up with the character's
            design and name while Nicieza came up with Deadpool's speech mannerisms. Liefeld, who was a fan of Teen
            Titans, showed the character to Fabian. Upon examination, Nicieza said that "he was Deathstroke from Teen
            Titans", and gave him the real name of "Wade Wilson" as a reference to Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke. Yet
            another inspiration to Deadpool was Spider-Man, who would make jokes during fights as well. Deadpool is a
            character that is related to multiple superheros. It is shown in the comics that Deadpool has a crush on
            spiderman.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by Joe Kelly, with then-newcomer Ed
            McGuinness as an artist. Deadpool became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics
            of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother Blind Al
            and his best friend Weasel. The ongoing series gained cult popularity for its unorthodox main character and
            its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the
            element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we
            wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying
            attention.

        <p>Wade lasted until issue #69, at which point it was Relaunched as a new title by Gail Simone with a similar
            character called Agent X in 2002. This occurred during a line wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with
            Cable becoming Soldier X and X-Force becoming X-Statix. Simone notes that 'When I took the Deadpool job, the
            revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make
            adjustments to the early scripts'. It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the
            supervillain Black Swan. Deadpool's manager, Sandi Brandenburg later founded Agency X with a mysterious man
            called Alex Hayden, who took the name dubbed Agent X. Deadpool later returned to the series. Simone left the
            title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor, but then returned to conclude
            with issues 13-15.</p>
