        <p>Great white sharks, like all other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which
            enables them to detect the electromagnetic field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are
            so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark
            to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but
            similar sense using their body's lateral line.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a
            body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a "rete mirabile" (Latin for
            "wonderful net"). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of
            the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by
            the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to
            14 °C (25 °F) above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and gills remain at sea
            temperature. When conserving energy, the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great
            white shark's success in raising its core temperature is an example of gigantothermy. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Therefore, the great white shark can be considered an endothermic poikilotherm or mesotherm because its body
            temperature is not constant but is internally regulated. Great whites also rely on the fat and oils
            stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans.
            Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that in
            addition to controlling the sharks' buoyancy, the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns.
            Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker
            than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Toxicity from heavy metals seems to have little negative effects on great white sharks. Blood samples taken
            from forty-three individuals of varying size, age and sex off the South African coast led by biologists from
            the University of Miami in 2012 indicates that despite high levels of mercury, lead, and arsenic, there was
            no sign of raised white blood cell count and granulate to lymphocyte ratios, indicating the sharks had
            healthy immune systems. This discovery suggests a previously unknown physiological defence against heavy
            metal poisoning. Great whites are known to have a propensity for "self-healing and avoiding age-related
            ailments".</p>
