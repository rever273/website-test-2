                C2935209), with a registered office at 130 Sutter Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104. We are the

                Policy.</p>
            <p class="p1">This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us in our business, including
                on our websites, mobile applications, and our related online and offline offerings (collectively, the
                “<b>Services</b>”). The Services include websites at fandom.com and wikia.org, and the respective

                websites at futhead.com, muthead.com and fanatical.com (and any related mobile applications).</p>
            <p class="p1">We respect your right to privacy. Our overall aim is to ensure that our collection and use of

                with applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <p class="p1">We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any
                material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You
                understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you continue
                to use the Services after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.</p>
            <h2 id="PERSONAL_INFORMATION_WE_COLLECT">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
            <p class="p1">The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with our Services
                and the requirements of applicable law.&nbsp;<b>Visitors</b>&nbsp;are people who access the Services.
                Visitors include&nbsp;<b>Registered Users</b>&nbsp;who access the Services through their accounts,
                and&nbsp;<b>Non-Registered Users</b>&nbsp;who access the Services without using an account. We recognize
                that most Visitors are Non-Registered Users.</p>
            <p class="p1">You do not need to be a Registered User in order to access most information on the Services.
                Being a Registered User is only required for certain activities, such as creating, managing, or
                administrating a Fandom community, making a contribution to a Fandom community that does not allow for
                contributions by non-Registered Users, submitting comments about other content on the Services, or
                participating in a chat forum. In addition, you must be a Registered User in order to make certain
                purchases or view certain content on our mobile applications.</p>
            <p><b>Information You Provide to Us</b></p>
            <p class="p1"><b>Account Creation</b>. When you create an account on the Services in order to become a

                purchase, view, or download certain content or products from the Services. Further, if you use the
                Fandom mobile app,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>you may indicate the communities in

            <p class="p1"><b>Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests</b>. We may run sweepstakes and contests. Contact
                information you provide may be used to inform you about the sweepstakes or contest and for other

                reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will

                qualifications for employment.</p>
            <p><b>Information Collected Automatically</b></p>
            <p class="p1"><b>Automatic Data Collection</b>. We may collect certain information automatically when you
                use the Services. This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC
                address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details
                about your browser, operating system or device, location information (including inferred location based
                off of your IP address), Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during, and after using
                the Services, information about the links you click, information about how you interact with the
                Services, including the frequency and duration of your activities, the search requests you submit on the
                Services, and other information about how you use the Services. If you use our browser extensions, we
                may also collect information about your activities on other sites in order to provide the extension’s
                intended functionality. We may attempt to infer other information about you based on this information or
                associate it with your accounts on other devices.</p>
            <p class="p1"><b>Crash Reports.</b> If you provide crash reports, such as when using our mobile app, we may
                collect personal information related to such crash reports, including detailed diagnostic information
                about your device and the activities that led to the crash.</p>
            <p class="p1"><b>Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information</b>. We, as well as third
                parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies,
                pixel tags, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the
                Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your devices that allow us and our
                partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="li1"><b>Cookies</b>. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to store your
                    preferences and facilitate and otherwise enhance your experience. Most browsers allow you to block
                    and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.</li>
                <li class="li1"><b>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons</b>. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of
                    code embedded in the Services that collects information about engagement on the Services. The use of
                    a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or
                    clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand
                    whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="li1"><b>Operationally Necessary.</b>&nbsp;This includes Technologies that allow you access to
                    our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular website behavior,
                    prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functionality;
                </li>
                <li class="li1"><b>Performance-Related.</b>&nbsp;We may use Technologies to assess the performance of
                    our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how you use our
                    Services (see Analytics below);</li>
                <li class="li1"><b>Functionality-Related.</b>&nbsp;We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you
                    enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when
                    you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items
                    viewed;</li>
                <li class="li1"><b>Advertising- or Targeting-Related.</b>&nbsp;We may use first party or third-party
                    Technologies to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Services or on
                    third-party websites.</li>

                verify your identity prior to responding to your request. Please note that your exercise of your rights
                is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of
                crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If we are unable to process your
                request via you authenticating yourself on the Services, we may verify your request by asking for
                information sufficient to confirm your identity, based on the information we have on file. Requests to
                exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature
                of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you
                if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.</p>
            <p class="p1">If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a
                request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process
                for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.</p>

                right digitally. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of one of our users,

                offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these
                programs, wherein you provide Personal Information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their
                email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also
                receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your
                Personal Information in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are
                entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value
                of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the
                referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services.
                Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw
                from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please <a
