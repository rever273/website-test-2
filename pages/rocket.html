        <p>Subject 89P13 is a raccoon who was genetically and cybernetically modified by the High Evolutionary, giving
            him enhanced intelligence and the ability to speak. Naming himself Rocket, he befriended fellow Halfworlders
            Lylla, Teefs and Floor, with the four believing they would soon be allowed to live in peace on a new planet.
            While aiding High Evolutionary in perfecting his experiments, Rocket discovered that he, along with his
            friends, were slated to be killed. Rocket attempted to free his friends, only for the High Evolutionary to
            kill Lylla. Rocket then attacked his former master, mutilating him, which inadvertently resulted in the
            deaths of Teefs and Floor. Afterwards, Rocket boarded a ship and fled into the cosmos.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While traveling the galaxy, Rocket befriended Groot, and the pair committed crimes and picked up bounties. In
            2014, they met Star-Lord, who convinced them to assist him in selling the Orb, which was being sought after
            by Ronan the Accuser, for a massive profit. However, when they discovered that the Orb contained the Power
            Stone, Rocket was convinced to risk everything to stop Ronan's plans from using the Infinity Stone to
            destroy Xandar. During the ensuing conflict, Rocket managed to assist his friends in destroying Ronan,
            although this resulted in Groot being killed. Rocket then became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy
            alongside the newly planted baby Groot.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Rocket continued working with the Guardians when they were hired by the Sovereign to slay an Abilisk.
            However, Rocket took the job as a way to steal Anulax Batteries with the intention to later sell them. This
            angered Ayesha, causing her to declare war on the Guardians and hire the Ravagers to capture them. Rocket
            and Groot were soon captured by Taserface under Yondu Udonta's command, forcing Rocket and Udonta to work
            together in order to break free and kill Taserface. During his time with Udonta, Rocket learned how to
            better himself and wishing to save his Guardians family, joined Udonta during the Battle on Ego's Planet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Four years later, the Guardians rescued Thor after the Asgardians were slaughtered by Thanos, who had
            initiated the Infinity War. The Guardians split up; while the rest of the team returned to Knowhere to find
            the Reality Stone, Rocket and Groot accompanied Thor to Nidavellir to obtain Stormbreaker. Using the Bifrost
            Bridge, the trio traveled to Earth to join the Battle of Wakanda, where he fought alongside Winter Soldier.
            Their efforts to stop Thanos were unsuccessful, and Rocket was one of the only Guardians to survive Thanos'
            subsequent mass slaughter, along with Nebula. Rocket joined the Avengers on their trip to the Garden, where
            he witnessed Thor decapitate Thanos.</p>
